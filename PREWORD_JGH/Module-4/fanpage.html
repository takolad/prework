<h2>Bio:</h2>

<p>
    Senses Fail is an American post-hardcore band that formed in 
    Ridgewood, New Jersey, United States, in 2001. Formed by vocalist 
    James "Buddy" Nielsen, drummer Dan Trapp, guitarists 
    Garrett Zablocki and Dave Miller, and bassist James Gill; 
    the band has seen many lineup changes, with Nielsen being 
    the only consistent member.
</p>

<p>
    Nielsen explained the band name, stating: "In Hinduism, they 
    believe that being alive is hell, and the only way to reach 
    Nirvana is to ultimately have no attachments to anything. So, 
    people go out and live in the middle of the woods and they don't 
    eat and don't drink. They just meditate because they've reached 
    such a high level where they're not attached to love, 
    relationships or anything. And if you want to reach the highest 
    level of being and see God, you have to have all your senses fail."
